# masters-proposal

Ideas and files for starting a master's proposal. This is 100% unofficial. Please see official guidelines when making descisions about a graduate program.

What the committee is (probably) looking for in any masters student:
-	Did the student gain extra experients over a UG student?
-	Did the student gain some degree of specialization?
-	Did the student gain familiarity with academic research?

##	Proposal
You can think of the proposal as a contract about what every one agrees you need to do in your defense.

Start with this [LaTeX Template](CSCI_MS_Proposal_Template.zip). I would upload it into a new [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) project.


Major sections of your proposal:
- Introduction
    - What is the big problem?
    - What is the solvable little problem?
    - How do you propose solving the little problem?
-	Previous Work
    - Show you know what others have done.
    - Use a reference manager to help. Most students (and faculty) use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-desktop).
    - The de facto website for finding papers is [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
    - Other sites have a smaller library, but are easier to work with (e.g. [Semantic Scholar](semanticscholar.org)).
    - LaTeX uses the bibtex citation format, so export from your reference manager into a .bib file.
- Theory
   - What is the math + whiteboard version of your idea?
   - This should be fairly developed in the proposal.
- Implementation
  - What have you done to code up the theory? 
  - For the proposal you should at least show that you have your feet wet.
- Results
  - How will you know when you are done?
  - How will you measure your results?
-	Plan
    - What are you going to do now?
    - Have a calendar of milestones.

## Logistics 

- You have to have everything done about a month before graduation. Don't plan on having all of your last semester to write.
- Students usually propose at least one semester before they defend.
